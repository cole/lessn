**is an extremely simple, personal url shortener written in PHP with MySQL and mod_rewrite.**

-----------------------------------------------------------

# Installation #

1. Open /lessn/-/config.php in a plaintext editor and create a Lessn username and password then enter your database connection details.

2. Upload the entire /lessn/ directory to your server. For the shortest urls, place it at the root of your site and rename to a single character. Example: http://doma.in/x/

3. Visit http://doma.in/x/-/ to Lessn a new url and grab the bookmarklets (the required database table is created automatically the first time you visit Lessn).

	NOTE:
		If your Lessn'd urls aren't working you probably didn't upload the .htaccess file. Enable "Show invisible files" in your FTP application.
